# Welcome to RHM webpage!

Rotochemical Heating Manager (RHM) is a simulation toolset for compact star matter based on provided equation of state (EoS). RHM is currently capable of:

- constructing mass-radius diagram
- constructing surface temperature-time cooling curve
    - Wide selection of neutrino-emitting processes
    - Supports disequilibrium/equilibrium cooling
    - Quark matter is seamlessly supported
- constructing non-equilibrium temperature profiles
- various easy-to-setup functionality (may or may not be implemented)
    - Tabulate/plot any EoS function as a radial dependence 
    - Investigate sophisticated quantities based on these radial dependencies 
    - Compare against other simulator
- tidal deformability calculation
- Extensive support for taking rotochemical heating effect into account
    - {math}`npe\mu uds` matter is supported, allowed in various combinations
    - Baryon and electric charge conservation is enforced

This webpage is dedicated to the documentation of RHM. The page is under construction and will evolve alongside with the development of RHM.
