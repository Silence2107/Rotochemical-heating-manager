# Welcome to RHM webpage!

Rotochemical Heating Manager (RHM) is a simulation toolset for compact star matter based on provided equation of state (EoS). RHM is currently capable of:

- constructing mass-radius diagram
- constructing surface temperature-time cooling curve
    - Supports non-equilibrium cooling
    - Supports equilibrium cooling
- constructing non-equilibrium temperature profiles (ROOT only)
- various easy-to-setup functionality (may or may not be implemented)
    - Tabulate/plot any EoS function as a radial dependence 
    - Investigate sophisticated quantities based on these radial dependencies 
    - Compare against other simulators
- Limited support for taking rotochemical heating effect into account (electron-related only yet)

This webpage is dedicated to the documentation of RHM. The page is under construction and will evolve alongside with the development of RHM.
